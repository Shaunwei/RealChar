                        The input to this tool should be a string
    > Insert_guest_datatable: "Use this tool whenever a guest confirms his or her name and number for a meeting, when you need to insert a name and phone number into a database to take his or her attendance.

                            The input to this tool should be a comma separated list of strings of length two, representing the name and the phone number you would like to insert into the database.
                            For example, `John,91827364` would be the input if you wanted to insert the name John and the phone number 91827364
                            If only `John` is provided, only insert the name John
